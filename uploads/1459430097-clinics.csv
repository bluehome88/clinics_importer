Caring, honest, empathic and approachable, Dr Victoria is renowned for her warm and friendly approach. And, like the best type of friend, she’s not afraid to guide you towards the best solution for you if your initial ideas won’t help you get the results you want.

Dr Victoria opened the Alva Street clinic in 2008, having spent half a decade prior to that working on a peripatetic basis at other clinics. Having her own premises, designed and equipped to her own specifications meant that she was able to offer not just superb yet relaxed service, but also build up her own in-house team of experts.

An experienced dental surgeon – whose previous patients include the wife of the Sultan of Brunei – it was a fascination with facial aesthetics that led Dr Victoria to expand her skills and undertake training in this area. Having trained with the best in the business, both in the UK and overseas, Dr Victoria has built up an enviable reputation – and loyal client base – over the last ten years. When you visit the clinic look out for the photographs of Victoria with friends Jane Iredale, Patrick Holford, Zein Obagi and Mauricio De Miao some of the worlds visionaries in helping people look their best.",Accredited 6th May 2015,"Chemical Peels , Cryolipolysis , Dermal Fillers , Laser / IPL Treatment Pigmented/Vas… , Mesotherapy , Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy , Sclerotherapy , Sculptra , Teeth Whitening , Ultrasonic Skin Tightening , Wrinkle relaxing injections ",https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/staticmap?center=%2855.9500310%2C+-3.2111996%29&zoom=15&size=240x240&markers=mid|red|%2855.9500310%2C+-3.2111996%29,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
